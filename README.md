# Keyphrase-GAN
This repository contains the code for the paper <a href="https://aaai.org/ojs/index.php/AAAI/article/view/7238">Keyphrase Generation for Scientific Articles using GANs</a>.We have built a novel adversarial method to improve upon the generation of keyphrases using supervised approaches.Our Implementation is built on the starter code from <a href = "https://github.com/kenchan0226/keyphrase-generation-rl"> keyphrase-generation-rl </a> and <a href = "https://github.com/memray/seq2seq-keyphrase-pytorch"> seq2seq-keyphrase-pytorch </a> . Pls comment any issues in the issues section.

## Dependencies 



## Adversarial Training
First start by creating a virtual environment and install all required dependencies.
```terminal
pip install virtualenv
virtualenv mypython
pip install -r requirements.txt
source mypython/bin/activate
```

### Data 
The GAN model is trained on close to 500000 examples of the kp20k dataset and evaluated on the Inspec (Huth) , Krapivin , NUS , Semeval Datasets . After Downloading this repo , create a `Data` folder within it . Download all the required datasets from [this](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1DbXV1mZXm_o9bgfwPV9PV0ZPcNo1cnLp) and store it in the `Data` folder . The Folders with `_sorted` suffix contain present keyphrases which are sorted in the order of there occurence , and the ones with `_seperated` suffix contains present and absent keyphrases seperated by a `<peos>` token . In order to preprocess the kp20k dataset , run 
```terminal
python3 preprocess.py -data_dir data/kp20k_sorted -remove_eos -include_peos
```

If you cant preprocess and want to temporarily run the repository , to can download the datasets with 10000 examples [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1YIJOAAR8rK8oiAfPK-5aJwgwlmw0uie_?usp=sharing) .

### Training the MLE model 
The first step in GAN training involves training the MLE model as a baseline using maximum likelihood loss . The paper has used CatSeq model as a baseline . In order to train Catseq model without copy attention run
```terminal
python3 train.py -data data/kp20k_sorted/ -vocab data/kp20k_sorted/ -exp_path exp/%s.%s -exp kp20k -epochs 25 -train_ml -one2many -one2many_mode 1 -batch_size 32
```
or with copy attention run
```terminal
python3 train.py -data data/kp20k_sorted/ -vocab data/kp20k_sorted/ -exp_path exp/%s.%s -exp kp20k -epochs 25 -train_ml -one2many -one2many_mode 1 -batch_size 32 -copy_attention
```

Note Down the Checkpoints Location while training .

### Training the Discriminator 

Now that the baseline MLE model is trained we need to train the Discriminator using the MLE model as Generator. The Discriminator is a hierarchal blstm which uses attention mechanism to calculate embeddings for all the keyphrases.

```terminal
python GAN_Training.py  -data data/kp20k_sorted/ -vocab data/kp20k_sorted/ -exp_path exp/%s.%s -exp kp20k -epochs 5 -copy_attention -train_ml -one2many -one2many_mode 1 -batch_size 32 -model [MLE_model_path] -train_discriminator 
```

All additional flags have been detailed at the end of the repository.

### Reinforcement Learning 
As Discriminator Gradients cannot directly backpropagate towards the Generator because of the Discrete Nature of text the Generator is trained by means of policy gradient reinforcement learning techniques . In order to train using RL run

```terminal
 python GAN_Training.py -data data/kp20k_sorted/ -vocab data/kp20k_sorted/ -exp_path exp/%s.%s -exp kp20k -epochs 20 -copy_attention -train_ml -one2many -one2many_mode 1 -batch_size 32 -model [model_path]  -train_rl   -Discriminator_model_path [Discriminator_path]
```

### Training Options
```
-D_hidden_dim : set hidden dimensions of Discriminator LSTM
-D_layers : set no.of layers in each LSTM in the Discriminator
-D_embedding_dim : No.of embedding dimensions to be used in the Discriminator 
-pretrained_Discriminator : supply a pretrained Discriminator in 2nd or later iterations of GAN Training.
-Discriminator_model_path : path to pretrained Discriminators
-learning_rate : Sets learning rate for Discriminator when used with -train_discriminator 
-learning_rate_rl : Sets learning rate for Generator during RL Training
